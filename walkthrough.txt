General notes:
- I decided to leave the area map file out, because it doesn't 
  make any sense in the context of this game, as all "areas"
  are just quarters, and you can only go forward in time.
- The data has been collected with a JS script from the Kauppalehti website
  (http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/porssi/porssikurssit/lista.jsp). Data for 
  a single stock can be downloaded as CSV from 
  http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/amstock/historydata.jsp?period=20&turnover=false&klid=[stock_id],
  where [stock_id] is an internal Kauppalehti stock ID. See resources/scrape-stocks.js for details.
- I added support for having a summary for a company, but didn't have time
  to write the content (except for TLV as a proof of concept).
- I also would've liked to add a description for quarters, so the quarter's real-life
  events could've been summarized, but didn't have time :/

How to win the game:
- The game is really easy to win, you just have to 
  buy stocks that stay profitable from 4/1996 through 4/2016.
- You can, for example, invest all your money in SAMPO (Sampo)
  in 4/1996, fast-forward through the quarters with 'nextquarter'
  and get a >600% return for your investment in 4/2016.
- Of course it's much more interesting to diversify your portfolio
  by buying different kinds of stocks at different times.

How to lose the game:
- You lose if your combined worth (capital + portfolio) is less than
  your initial capital (1000 000 mk).
- You can, for example, fast-forward to 2/2009, go all-in on TLV (Talvivaara),
  and watch your money fade into nothing in a couple of years.
